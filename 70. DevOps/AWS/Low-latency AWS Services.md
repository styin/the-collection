1. To deliver content faster to the end user, AWS provides [[Amazon CloudFront]], which serves as a Content Delivery Network.
2. To build applications delivering low-latency services to the end user, AWS provides three options:
	1. You can use [[AWS Local Zones]] as an extension of an AWS Region to place resources in multiple locations closer to your end users.
	2. You can use [[AWS Wavelength]] Zones to build applications that deliver ultra-low latencies to 5G devices and end users. Wavelength deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks.
	3. [[AWS Outposts]] brings native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility.
