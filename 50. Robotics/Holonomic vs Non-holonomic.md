>A holonomic constraint can be expressed via the state variables of the system, and time. Consider a disc that rolls without slipping along a line. Lets say you want to constrain the final clock angle of the wheel at some time `t`. That clock angle is a function of it's position since it rolls without slipping.

>A nonholonomic constraint would be the fuel used to drive a car from point A to point B on a 2D plane. There are infinite number of ways to get from point A to point B. One cannot calculate the amount of fuel remaining in the car based on it's position and velocity at point B.
